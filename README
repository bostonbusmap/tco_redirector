This is a simple redirector app for Android, for the Twitter shortlink URLs starting with http://t.co and https://t.co. It attaches to any application which opens links to those addresses, does a HEAD request for what the shortlink is pointing to, then launches a new Intent toward that site.

I wrote this mainly to work around a problem on my Android tablet with my Twitter app where Youtube videos were being opened in the browser instead of in the Youtube app. YMMV. Pull requests appreciated!
